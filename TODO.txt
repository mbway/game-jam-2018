# Bugs
- Weapon tray doesn't ever remove weapons. Probably want an 'inventory_changed' signal to account for both addition and removal
- weapon tray should have a fixed ordering
- shooting sounds crackle when mouse is directly over player
- custom mouse cursor seems to only last a single game until it is reset
- can switch weapons when dead
- seems to be a race condition with the weapon slots GUI so that when re-spawning the new pistol is added first (which fails) then the old pistol is removed, rather than the other way around. So after re-spawning the pistol isn't on the slots GUI
    - while you're at it, might want to have all the weapons in the slots and only change their visibility
- on the AI test level, navigate to the area where there is a gap but you have to drop down rather than double jumping because there is dirt in the way. Drop into the hole then without jumping, walk to the left or right until you hit the side, then try to walk the other way. You will be stuck and have to jump to get free.

short term todo
- show names above players
- color pallete to choose for players. Maybe have a globals pallete. Lobby needs a color picker popup
- health pack
- parallax background
- ammo
- reload animation and drop magazine
- ai

# TODO
- support multiple resolutions. have the option to allow the game window to stretch too. ie. could render in 480p but stretch to be 1080p for performance if you like. Also necessary for supporting mobile since they have very different resolutions to desktops.
- need more sounds for things
    - shells hitting the ground
    - footsteps
    - reload sounds (once reload added)
    - damage
    - death
    - switching weapon?
- with the new jumping mechanism, using Engine.time_scale, can do bullet time :D
- need a better name than 'power offence'
- Large canister shell for the laser gun
- themed UI, create sprites for buttons and choose colors and style etc
- shield as well as health, with pickups to recharge
- code organisation
    - pull out the code for the different game modes. Try to combine them to allow for overrule mode
    - choose the map then the game mode. all game modes on all maps
    - multiple spawns in capture the flag

    - music on/off
    - gamepad and arrow key support for UI buttons
    - click to cycle available maps
    - better level screenshots
- >2 players would require
    - re-thinking the inventory and score UI
    - having a concept of teams

- fullscreen option (and keyboard shortcut)
- plasma ball gun with bullet drop (like the one in raze)
- main menu music
- names above players rather than health percent
- laser sights for players using gamepads to make aiming easier
- could implement an area effect which slows players down, could be created from a 'goo gun' type of thing or perhaps be built into particular areas of the map
- try out using a second reactivity constant when in the air (I'm thinking you should have less control when in the air, but maybe that won't feel good)
- try bullet trails with line2D <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5DwZZ0fZDg&feature=youtu.be>
- red dot with RayCast2D <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esZdJegvANc&t=627s>
