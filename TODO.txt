# Bugs
- Weapon tray doesn't ever remove weapons. Probably want an 'inventory_changed' signal to account for both addition and removal
- weapon tray should have a fixed ordering
- can't edit player names in the lobby
- shooting sounds crackle when mouse is directly over player
- rendering of guns flicker when aiming directly up
- custom mouse cursor seems to only last a single game until it is reset
- can switch weapons when dead
- seems to be a race condition with the weapon slots GUI so that when re-spawning the new pistol is added first (which fails) then the old pistol is removed, rather than the other way around. So after re-spawning the pistol isn't on the slots GUI
    - while you're at it, might want to have all the weapons in the slots and only change their visibility

# TODO
- upgrade the old maps in OldMaps then remove
- with the new jumping mechanism, using Engine.time_scale, can do bullet time :D
- move away from using OS.get_tick_msec() to allow the game to be slowed down for debugging. accumulate the given delta values instead
- need a better name than 'power offence'
- Large canister shell for the laser gun
- Detect when player is above floor. I don't think the obstacle avoidance is working because the ai releases jump immediately
- themed UI, create sprites for buttons and choose colors and style etc
- shield as well as health, with pickups to recharge
- code organisation
    - pull out the code for the different game modes. Try to combine them to allow for overrule mode
    - choose the map then the game mode. all game modes on all maps
    - multiple spawns in capture the flag
    - dynamic flag spawning
    - parent flags to player holding
- number keys to switch weapons
- main menu
    - input method selection
    - handle >2 players by selecting _which_ gamepad to assign to each player
    - music on/off
    - gamepad and arrow key support for UI buttons
    - click to cycle available maps
    - better level screenshots
- >2 players would require
    - re-thinking the inventory and score UI
    - having a concept of teams
- hide cursor and render a custom cursor
- tweak the camera view
    - view more in the direction that the player is aiming
    - possibly weight vertically more
- ammo
    - UI to show ammo depletion
    - clip size and reloading
- bots
- online multiplayer
- show invincibility somehow
- lighting effect around pickup station
- more pickups
    - health
    - invincibility
- skybox with parallax
- lights and particle effects
    - blood
    - flag captures
    - muzzle smoke?
- explosives
    - grenades
    - rockets
    - mines
    - homing missile?
    - particle trails
- scalable UI elements (for different resolutions)
- fullscreen option (and keyboard shortcut)
- plasma ball gun with bullet drop (like the one in raze)
- main menu music
- names above players rather than health percent
- laser sights for players using gamepads to make aiming easier
- could add one-way platforms quite easily
- could implement an area effect which slows players down, could be created from a 'goo gun' type of thing or perhaps be built into particular areas of the map
- try out using a second reactivity constant when in the air (I'm thinking you should have less control when in the air, but maybe that won't feel good)
- try bullet trails with line2D <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5DwZZ0fZDg&feature=youtu.be>
- red dot with RayCast2D <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esZdJegvANc&t=627s>
    - useful for gamepad where aiming is harder
- FPS counter. enable/disable through the options menu
- subtle footstep sound?
- damage sound?
- environmental hazards
    - toxic waste (green with water splashing effect when walking on)
    - automatic turrets
- aim assist for gamepad players
