# Godot Gotchas
- to use margins in UI elements, don't use the 'Margins' settings because these frequently get overwritten and reset. Instead, use a MarginContainer and set the 'custom variables' section (the 'Margins' settings are reset even on the margin container)
- `new()` creates new objects, `instance()` creates a runtime copy of a resource like a scene
- don't use OS.get_tick_msec() because it doesn't scale as Engine.timescale changes
- input events:
    - https://godot.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/tutorials/inputs/inputevent.html#doc-inputevent
    - first `_input` is called, then `_gui_input` then `_unhandled_input`. So gameplay related input should be handled in `_unhandled_input` so that the GUI can intercept and process events before hand.
    - calling `event.accept_event()` will prevent propagation
    - to allow mouse events through, a Control element should set its `mouse_filter` attribute

## Godot 3 changes
- `_fixed_process` -> `_physics_process`
