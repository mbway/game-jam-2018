- to use margins in UI elements, don't use the 'Margins' settings because these frequently get overwritten and reset. Instead, use a MarginContainer and set the 'custom variables' section (the 'Margins' settings are reset even on the margin container)


# Collision Layers
layer 1 = player and map
layer 2 = projectile and map
layer 3 = projectile and player

Player:         1
BulletCollider:         3
Map:            1   2
Shell:              2
Bullet:             2   3
Laser:                  3
